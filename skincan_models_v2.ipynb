People should have awareness to maintain health, especially the health of the skin. Therefore, by utilizing machine learning, cloud computing to create a skin cancer detection application by identifying the input image to remind the public the importance of maintaining healthy skin. In this project, We have a problem formulation as follows:\n",

This application uses Deep Learning algorithms to predict various skin diseases to achieve maximum accuracy in predicting skin diseases at an early stage. Feature extraction plays a key role in the classification of skin diseases. In addition, Explainable AI is used to interpret decisions made by our machine learning models. With this application, hopefully, it can help users to detect skin diseases early so they can take preventive measures.\n",
