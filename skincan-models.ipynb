    "\n",
    "At this time there are so many dangers that can lurk human health, even in this era of pandemic, maintaining health is very important for everyone. People should have awareness to maintain health, especially the health of the skin. Therefore, by utilizing machine learning, cloud computing to create a skin cancer detection application by identifying the input image to remind the public the importance of maintaining healthy skin. In this project, We have a problem formulation as follows:\n",
    "* How to detect various skin cancers in humans through the application?\n",
    "* How to treat skin cancer early?\n",
    "* How accurately does this application detect skin cancer? \n",
    "\n",
    "Our team wants to solve this problem because we want someone who has the potential for cancer to avoid a more serious problem, so that users who use this application can take preventive measures to prevent this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How did your team come up with this project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build an application that can help the public and health workers to detect skin diseases in humans, including skin cancer. This application uses Deep Learning algorithms to predict various skin diseases to achieve maximum accuracy in predicting skin diseases at an early stage. Feature extraction plays a key role in the classification of skin diseases. In addition, Explainable AI is used to interpret decisions made by our machine learning models. With this application, hopefully, it can help users to detect skin diseases early so they can take preventive measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Based on your knowledge and explorations, tell us the Machine Learning Part of your capstone?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, weâ€™re using Python as main programming language, Tensorflow as mandatory library, Sckit-learn and keras as libraries, AI Platform as platform, TFLite as Tools for Model Deployment to Android, Kaggle as dataset resource, Google Colab as IDE, and Machine Learning Model as main the feature in our app.\n"
